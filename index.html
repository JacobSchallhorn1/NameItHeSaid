	<h2>What is a meme?</h2>
	<p>
		The age old question. If you are past your teenage years and aren't a frequent user of social media or the Internet in general, then 
		you have most likely asked this very question. Wikipedia will tell you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme" target="blank" >this</a>.
		However if you didn't understand that then let me dumb it down a little. A meme is an inside joke that is usually in the form of a picture or video.
		People find them funny because they can relate to them or understand the "secret" meaning behind them.However there are outlier memes that don't fit
		this description but I will get to those later. Memes usually have many different layers to them such as their content,template, and merging of multiple of each.<!--E-->

		To the right you will see an example of a meme. The joke with this image is that Trump has build a persona on the internet that he wants to build a wall.
		He wants to keep from having immigrants enter the country illegally. However the internet took this serious topic and turned it into a meme.
		The funny part about this is that trump wants to build a wall so it fits perfectly into this situation. Also with this meme you can see an 
		example of a meme format/template. Memes often use the same template in order to easily organize the meme and/or reference the original.
