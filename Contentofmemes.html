		<h2>Meme content</h2>
	
		<p>
			The content of a meme is what is at its core. There are new memes about different subjects all the time.
			Once people pick up on a funny joke or see a funny picture they start making memes about it. There will be a huge wave of memes 
			and it will slowly die out within a few weeks. A relatively new topic is that of tik tok. It is an app where people put audio
			over a video that they make. This is a source for most good memes as of 12/11/18. 
		</p>
		<h4>Guess they never miss, huh?</h4>
		<br><br><br>
		<p>One wonderful meme that tik tok has blessed us with is "hit or miss". The song by iLOVEFRiDAy has taken the tik tok and meme world by storm.
			This is probably one of the most popular memes of 2018. However it has also recieved its fair share of criticism.
